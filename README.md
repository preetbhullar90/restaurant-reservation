## Introduction

This is my 4th project at code institute.This is restaurant website designed to display to the customers and allow them to make a booking and edit,view and delete the booking.In this website customers need to login or register on the website for booking, otherwise they can't see any booking and the website will take them on login page.This website deployed on heroku.
